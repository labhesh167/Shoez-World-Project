## 🔐 Security & Authorization

Shoez World uses **JWT (JSON Web Token)**-based authentication and authorization for securing API endpoints.

### 🔑 How JWT Works in the Project:
- On **successful login**, the backend generates a **JWT token**.
- This token is sent back to the client (Angular frontend) and stored in the browser’s **local storage**.
- Every subsequent request to secured endpoints (like placing orders, viewing order history, admin dashboard, etc.) includes the **JWT token in the HTTP header**:
